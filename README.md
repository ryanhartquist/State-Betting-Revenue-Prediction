# Project: Team Repository
This repository will serve as your group's project repository for the semester. Currently, it contains three directories:
* `data`: This directory will house your data files, whether they are archival from a 3rd party or scraped by your team
* `python_files`: If you use Python for your project, house those files here
* `r_files`: If your project relies on any R files, place them within this directory

You are free to create additional directories for whatever purpose you need. Be sure to keep things organized. At the end of the semester, I will use this repository to grade your project. Do not upload script files, data files, or additional files to Canvas. You will only upload your Word/pdf document to Canvas.
